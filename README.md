Keep Functions.py in the same fold as Atlas.py when you run the game.

Controls:
Arrow keys: move cursor
return: View inventory (or interact with dialogue)
spacebar: Look around/Fish (or interact with dialogue)
'A': View Atlas (once aquired)

If you spawn in a landlocked place and are unable to move, just restart the game.
